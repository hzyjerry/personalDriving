This 4D strategic value was computed with modifications to the original code, which had 2 mistakes:

1. The reward was being set to -Inf when the cars were outside of the grid, which
is not the proper thing to do and resulted in infinities and numerical issues.
- Fix: for points that are outside of the grid, project them back onto the grid and evaluate the strategic value at the projected on-grid point.

2. The exponentiation in the Boltzmann distribution for the human's preference
was being computed without subtracting the maximum reward from the reward, which
caused numerical overflow due to the large reward. This overflow led to infinities
and NaNs.
- Fix: subtract maximum reward such that exponent is always non-positive, which avoids overflow.

This strategic value also includes a robot reward for the relative velocity: (relative velocity - goal relative velocity)^2, where the goal relative velocity is when the robot is driving 35 m/s and the human is driving 32 m/s (but converted to the custom units used in the DSG_toolbox).
