This 4D strategic value was computed with modifications to the original code, which had 2 mistakes:

1. The reward was being set to -Inf when the cars were outside of the grid, which
is not the proper thing to do and resulted in infinities and numerical issues.
- Fix: for points that are outside of the grid, evaluate their reward (without multiplying it by the number of remaining time steps) to approximate the strategic value.

2. The exponentiation in the Boltzmann distribution for the human's preference
was being computed without subtracting the maximum reward from the reward, which
caused numerical overflow due to the large reward. This overflow led to infinities
and NaNs.
- Fix: subtract maximum reward such that exponent is always non-positive, which avoids overflow.

Problems with this strategic value:

- For points outside the grid, their reward is not multiplied by the number of remaining time steps and is then added to the reward of the point from which the car exited the grid. Though this slightly helps with preventing the robot from wanting to be on the edge of the grid corresponding to a large y relative value, it is not the right thing to do. Also it causes the robot to want to be right behind the human instead of overtaking properly
